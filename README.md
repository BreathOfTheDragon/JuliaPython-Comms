# JuliaPython-Comms

This is a simple project which covers the communication between Julia and Python.

The client is a python program, and the server is a Julia program.

Simply start the Julia serve by typing 'Julia server.jl' into the terminal to start the Julia program.
Then, in another terminal, type 'python3 client.py' to run the client and connect to the server.
